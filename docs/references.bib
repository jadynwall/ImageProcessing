	abstract = {Optical character recognition (OCR) is an area which has always received special attention. OCR systems are typically built on the strategy of divide and conquer, rather than recognizing documents at one go. They utilize several stages during the course of recognition. There have been many stages in a typical OCR system, preprocessing stage in considered to be indispensable. An input image or information need to be normalized and converted into format acceptable by OCR system. OCR systems typically assume that documents were printed with a single direction of the text and that the acquisition process did not introduce a relevant skew. Practically this assumption is not very strong and printed document could be skewed at some angle with horizontal axis. In this paper, we have proposed a new technique for skew estimation of image document. In the proposed scheme, multiscale properties of an image are utilized together with principal component analysis to estimate the orientation of principal axis of clustered data.},

	abstract = {Illumination conditions cause problems for many computer vision algorithms. In particular, shadows in an image can cause segmentation, tracking, or recognition algorithms to fail. In this paper we propose a method to process a 3-band colour image to locate, and subsequently remove shadows. The result is a 3-band colour image which contains all the original salient information in the image, except that the shadows are gone.},

	abstract = {The fact about the blackjack is that the dealer gains advantages all the time in the normal casino since the rules can be changed by the casino. The way they change rules affects the probabilities of winning for both players and dealers. Therefore, it is important for the players to learn how could the house edge occur and the strategy to maximize their advantages individually. The theoretical analysis and simulations of the experiment by computer programs, for the sake of data, are the tools for solving the problems mentioned in this paper. The house edge is resulted by difference of the bet and the probability of winning the game, and the basic strategy created slightly advantages for the players in the case that house edge always exists.},
